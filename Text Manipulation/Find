sudo find /var/log/ -perm -g=w ! -perm /o=rw > /home/bob/data.txt
To make this easier to understand, the logic of the command can be broken down like this:

-> Permissions for the group have to be at least w. If there's also an extra r or x in there, 
   it will still match.
-> Permissions for others have not to be r or w. That means, if any of these two permissions,
   r or w match for others, the result has to be excluded.
