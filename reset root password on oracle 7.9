ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Interrupt GRUB at Boot
Reboot the system
When the GRUB menu appears, highlight the kernel entry (usually the first one)

Press e to edit

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Edit the Kernel Boot Line
Find the line starting with:
linux16 /vmlinuz...
At the end of that line, append:
rd.break enforcing=0
âœ… rd.break drops you into a minimal initramfs shell
âœ… enforcing=0 disables SELinux temporarily (important!)

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Remount Sysroot
After booting into the emergency shell:
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
You're now inside the real root filesystem.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Reset the Password
passwd root
Enter your new password twice. You should see "all authentication tokens updated successfully".

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Relabel SELinux Contexts
This is critical â€” otherwise the system may reject your new password on next boot.
touch /.autorelabel
This tells SELinux to relabel all files on next boot â€” including /etc/shadow.

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Exit and Reboot
exit
exit
System will reboot and automatically relabel (may take time).
