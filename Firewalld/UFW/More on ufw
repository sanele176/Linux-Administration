Set up a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic to this machine on port 80.
- ufw allow 80

Set up a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic to this machine on port 53, through the TCP protocol.
- ufw allow 53/tcp

Set up a firewall rule to deny incoming traffic to this machine on port 443, through the TCP protocol.
- ufw deny 443/tcp

Delete a firewall rule denying incoming traffic to this machine on port 443, through the TCP protocol (That is created in previous step).
- ufw delete deny 443/tcp

Allow all traffic that is coming from the following IP address 207.45.232.181.
- ufw allow from 207.45.232.181

Allow all traffic coming from any IP in this network range: 10.11.12.0 to 10.11.12.255 (i.e., 10.11.12.0/24). Add the required rule.
- ufw allow from 10.11.12.0/24

There's a firewall rule that denies any traffic coming from the 10.0.0.19 IP address. 
But this rule is in an incorrect spot (after an allow rule for the 10.0.0.0/24 range). 
So traffic is never denied because the rule is never matched. Correct this mistake.

- ufw status numbered
- ufw delete deny from 10.0.0.19
- ufw insert 1 deny from 10.0.0.19
