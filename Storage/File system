Create an xfs filesystem with the label "DataDisk" on /dev/vdb
- mkfs.xfs -L "DataDisk"  /dev/vdb

Create an ext4 filesystem with 2048 inodes on /dev/vdc.
- mkfs.ext4 -N 2048 /dev/vdc

Configure the system to automatically mount /dev/vdc when it boots up. This partition has an ext4 filesystem on it. 
It should mount the filesystem to the /test directory. This directory does not exist. Make sure you create it first.
Also, make sure this filesystem is checked on boot.
For now, you do not need to reboot the system after making the required changes.

- mkdir /test
- vi /etc/fstab
  /dev/vdc  /test  ext4  defaults  0 2
- mount -a (to test)

Configure the system to automatically use /dev/vdb as swap when it boots up.
For now, you do not need to reboot the system after making the required changes.

- vi /etc/fstab
 /dev/vdb  none  swap  defaults 0 0
- mount -a
- swapon /dev/vdb

/dev/vdb1 is currently mounted with the rooption, so it's read-only. Remount it with the rw option so it becomes read-write
- mount -o remount,rw /dev/vdb1 /mnt
