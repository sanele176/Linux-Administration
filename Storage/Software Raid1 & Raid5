Raid1 - Mirroring - (minimum 2 disk)

- sudo yum install mdadm -y
- sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
- sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0 (check creation progress)
- sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

Persistent mount
- blkid /dev/md0 (to get block id)
- vi /etc/fstab
- e.g UUID=a1f3082b-87b9-4022-92e3-7408a00d81e4 /opt ext4  defaults 0 0

Save the RAID configuration:
- sudo mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf
if not save run
- sudo mdadm --assemble --scan

Manage Raid
- sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 (add disk)
Simulate a fail
- sudo mdadm --fail /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
- sudo mdadm --remove /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1

Advantages:
Data Redundancy:
Provides a full copy of all data on the mirrored disk,
 
Simple Recovery:
Recovery is straightforward: replace the failed disk, and the system automatically rebuilds the mirror.

Read Performance:
Reads are faster since the system can access data from either disk simultaneously.

Easy Implementation:
RAID 1 is simple to configure and requires minimal setup compared to more complex RAID levels.

Disadvantages:

Storage Inefficiency:
Requires double the storage space since every piece of data is duplicated. 

Write Performance:
Writes can be slower because data needs to be written to both disks simultaneously.

Cost:
Higher cost per usable GB due to mirroring.

Limited Scalability:
RAID 1 only supports two disks, limiting its scalability compared to other RAID levels.

***************************************************************
Raid 5 - Striping with Parity (minimum 3 disk)

- mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md1 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf
- mdadm --detail /dev/md1
- mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf

Simulate a fail
- sudo mdadm --fail /dev/md1 /dev/sdf
- sudo mdadm --remove /dev/md1 /dev/sdf
- sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdf (re-add it and raid will auto rebuild

Grow or add additional disk
- sudo mdadm --add /dev/md1 /dev/sdg
- sudo mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-devices=4
- sudo resize2fs /dev/md1
- cat /proc/mdstat

Advantages:

Fault Tolerance:
Can tolerate a single disk failure while maintaining data integrity, as parity is distributed across all disks.

Good Balance:
Provides a good balance between storage efficiency, redundancy, and performance for read-heavy environments.

Read Performance:
Reads are faster since data is striped across multiple disks, enabling parallel access.

Disadvantages:

Write Performance:
Writes are slower due to the overhead of calculating and writing parity.

Limited Fault Tolerance:
Can only tolerate one disk failure. If a second disk fails during a rebuild, all data is lost.

Rebuild Time:
Rebuilding the array after a disk failure can take a long time

Raid Common issues
************************************************************************
- raids being dropped at boot (error devices can not be found)
  - sudo mdadm --examine --scan
  - sudo mdadm --assemble --scan
  error : Duplicate MD device names in conf file were found : due to running save command multiple times
  - fix : manually delete duplicate on vi /etc/mdadm.conf
  - then rebuild raid : sudo mdadm --assemble --scan
