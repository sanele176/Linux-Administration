/etc/hosts on Nautilus App 2 server requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:

getfacl  /etc/hosts

1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.
- chown root:root /etc/hosts

2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.
- setfacl -m o:r-- /etc/hosts

3. User yousuf must not have any permissions on the file.
- setfacl -m yousuf:--- /etc/hosts

4. User ryan should be granted read only permission on the file.
- setfacl -m ryan:r-- /etc/hosts


In your home directory, you will find a file named specialfile. 
Add an ACL permission to this file so that the user called john can read and write to it

- setfacl -m u:john:rw specialfile

From the file called specialfile, remove the ACL permissions for the user called john
- setfacl --remove user:john specialfile

To the file called specialfile, add an ACL permission for the group called mail. The mail group should get permissions to read and execute this file
-setfacl --modify group:mail:r-x specialfile


In your home directory, you will find a directory called collection. 
Use the setfacl command recursively, so that ACL entries are modified on the directory itself but also all the files and subdirectories it may contain. 
The ACL permissions should allow the user called john to read, write and execute all entries within this directory.

- setfacl -R --modify user:john:rwx collection
