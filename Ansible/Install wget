Create an inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host and add all app servers in it.
Create an Ansible playbook /home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml to install wget package on all  app servers using Ansible yum module.
Make sure user thor should be able to run the playbook on jump host.
Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 
so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
