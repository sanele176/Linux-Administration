Question: xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. 
After several meetings and recommendations, they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. 
We would like you to perform the following steps:
Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.
Create an email account ammar@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by B4zNgHA7Ya.
Set its mail directory to /home/ammar/Maildir.
Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

- yum install postfix -y
- yum install dovecot -y

vi /etc/postfix/main.conf
(Below lines already exit uncommect, edit where aplicable)
myhostname = stmail01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks =172.16.238.0/24, 127.0.0.0/24
home_mailbox = Maildir/

useradd ammar
passwd ammar B4zNgHA7Ya
telnet stmail01 25

Dovecot
(Below lines already exit uncommect, edit where aplicable)

vi/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
protocols = imap pop3 lmtp

vi/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
mail_location =maildir:~/Maildir

vi/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
disable_plaintext_auth = yes
auth_mechanisms = plain login

vi/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf

unix_listener auth-userdb {
#mode = 0666
user = postfix
group = postfix
}
systemctl start dovecot
