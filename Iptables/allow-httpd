Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. 
Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.
Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:8089 command from jump host.

- use netstat -tulnp (determine service already using port)
- kill the service
- systemctl start httpd

IPtables rule

# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8089 -j ACCEPT
The command above is for opening the incoming port.

# iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 8089 -j ACCEPT
The command above is for opening the outgoing port.

service iptable save (to save)
systemctl restart iptables
