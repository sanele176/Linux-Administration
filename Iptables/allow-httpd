Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. 
Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.
Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:8089 command from jump host.

- use netstat -tulnp (ditermine service already using port)
- kill the service
- systemctl start httpd

IPtables rule
