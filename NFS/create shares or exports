An NFS server is already running and active in the system. Configure the existing NFS server to share the /home directory in read-only mode. 
Allow access to any client within the CIDR range 10.0.0.0/24.
Note: Make sure you reexport the configuration file using exportfs -r

- vi /etc/exports
 /home 10.0.0.0/24(ro)
- exportfs -r
- exportfs -v

For this step, manually mount the NFS share with the following properties:
The IP of the NFS server is 127.0.0.1.
The remote directory you should mount from 127.0.0.1 is /home.
Mount this share in the local directory /mnt

- mount 127.0.0.1:/home /mnt

For this step, configure the system to automatically mount an NFS share when it boots up:
The share is on the server with the IP address 127.0.0.1.
The remote directory you should mount from the NFS server is /home
Mount it in the local directory /mnt
Use defaults in the mount options

- vi /etc/fstab
127.0.0.1:/home   /mnt  nfs  defaults  0 0

Share the /home directory with any client with an IP address in the CIDR range: 192.0.0.0/24. Make this share read-only.
Share the same /home directory, but this time, with any client with the exact IP address 127.0.0.10. Make this share read-write. 
Besides the read-write option, also enable the no_root_squash option.

- vi /etc/exports
/home 192.0.0.0/24(ro) 127.0.0.10(rw,no_root_squash)
- exportfs -r
- exportfs -v
