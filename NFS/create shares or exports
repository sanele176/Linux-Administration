Install and configure NFS in Centos
- Install the nfs-utils package which provides the necessary NFS components.
  sudo dnf install nfs-utils -y

- Create a directory to share. For example, weâ€™ll use /mnt/nfs_share:
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share

- Set proper permissions. You can adjust these based on your security needs. For a simple, open share:
  sudo chmod 777 /mnt/nfs_share

- Configure NFS Exports
  Edit the /etc/exports file to define which directories to share and what access options to allow.
  sudo vi /etc/exports
  /mnt/nfs_share  *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
Explanation of Options:
rw: Allow read and write access.
sync: Write changes to disk before replying.
no_root_squash: Preserve root privileges for clients (use with caution)

- Export the Shares
Make the changes take effect by exporting the directories:
sudo exportfs -rav
-r: Re-export all directories.
-a: Export all directories listed in /etc/exports.
-v: Verbose mode to show details.

To verify, run:
sudo exportfs -v

- Configure Firewall Settings
  Allow NFS traffic through the firewall. Run the following commands:
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload

- Start and Enable NFS Services
  Enable and start the NFS server service:
  sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server

- Mount on client side
  sudo mount -t nfs server_ip:/mnt/nfs_share /mnt/nfs_client
*************************************************************************************************************************************************

An NFS server is already running and active in the system. Configure the existing NFS server to share the /home directory in read-only mode. 
Allow access to any client within the CIDR range 10.0.0.0/24.
Note: Make sure you reexport the configuration file using exportfs -r

- vi /etc/exports
 /home 10.0.0.0/24(ro)
- exportfs -r
- exportfs -v

For this step, manually mount the NFS share with the following properties:
The IP of the NFS server is 127.0.0.1.
The remote directory you should mount from 127.0.0.1 is /home.
Mount this share in the local directory /mnt

- mount 127.0.0.1:/home /mnt

For this step, configure the system to automatically mount an NFS share when it boots up:
The share is on the server with the IP address 127.0.0.1.
The remote directory you should mount from the NFS server is /home
Mount it in the local directory /mnt
Use defaults in the mount options

- vi /etc/fstab
127.0.0.1:/home   /mnt  nfs  defaults  0 0

Share the /home directory with any client with an IP address in the CIDR range: 192.0.0.0/24. Make this share read-only.
Share the same /home directory, but this time, with any client with the exact IP address 127.0.0.10. Make this share read-write. 
Besides the read-write option, also enable the no_root_squash option.

- vi /etc/exports
/home 192.0.0.0/24(ro) 127.0.0.10(rw,no_root_squash)
- exportfs -r
- exportfs -v
