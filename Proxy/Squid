Solution:
sudo vi /etc/squid/squid.conf
And change the line http_access allow localnet to http_access deny localnet

The IP you should use in this acl is 203.0.110.5. 
Now add a new rule that tells the proxy server to allow access to the acl named vpn.

Solution: 
Edit the /etc/squid/squid.conf file:

sudo vi /etc/squid/squid.conf
and Save the below changes in it:
Add this line

acl vpn src 203.0.110.5
Add the below line in the same file before the http_access deny all line:

http_access allow vpn
