Question : We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location,
so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.
On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. 
Use those keys to perform the following actions.

Task 1 : Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
Task 2 : Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).
  
Step 1. Login on storage server & switch to root user 
Step 3.  Import gpg Private & Public key 

   gpg --import public_key.asc
   gpg --import private_key.asc

Step 4. Kindly verify keys are imported successfully
   gpg --list-keys
   gpg --list-secret-keys

Step 5. Will encrypt the file txt in to asc in same folder path 
   gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armor < encrypt_me.txt  -o encrypted_me.asc

Step 6. Will decrypt the file asc in to txt  using passphrase within same folder path 
   gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt
