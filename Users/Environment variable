Print our current user's (bob) environment and save the output in the /home/bob/env file.
You can use the redirection to save your command's output in a file: [your-command] > /home/bob/env

- env > /home/bob/env

Add an environment variable for user bob.
The variable name should be MYVAR and its value should be TRUE

vi ~/.bashrc
add the variable at the end of the file:
export MYVAR=TRUE

save the file and run:
source ~/.bashrc

- Make sure that this command gets executed for any user that logs in to the system:
 echo Welcome to our server!

sudo vi /etc/profile.d/welcome.sh
echo "Welcome to our server!"

- Add the value of $PATH variable for user bob to include $HOME/.config/bin location in the path.
vi /home/bob/.bashrc
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$HOME/.config/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc
