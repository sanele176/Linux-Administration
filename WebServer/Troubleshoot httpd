Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, 
as its Apache service is not reachable on port 5001 (which is the Apache port). 
The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.
Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. 
Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.
Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:5001 command from jump host.

- netstat -tulpn |grep 5001
- kill (process id using aboove port)
- systemctl restart httpd
Allow tcp on port 5001
- iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5001 -j ACCEPT
- service iptables save
- curl http://stapp01:5001
