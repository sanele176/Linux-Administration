a. Install Apache Server on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 8085 port (do not bind it to 127.0.0.1 only, 
    keep it default i.e let Apache listen on server's IP, hostname, localhost, 127.0.0.1 etc).
b. Install Nginx webserver on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 8092.
c. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server for Apache.
d. There is a sample index file /home/thor/index.html on Jump Host, copy that file to Apache's document root.
e. Make sure to start Apache and Nginx services.
f. You can test final changes using curl command, e.g curl http://<backup server IP or Hostname>:8092.

Solution
1. At first copy sample index file from jump server to backup server
      scp /home/index.html clint@stbkp01:/tmp/
2. Login on Backup server  ssh clint@stbkp01
3. Switch to  root user : sudo su -
3. Install the packages Apache & Nginx. 
    yum install httpd
4. For Nginx , 1st we need to install epel repo
  yum install epel-release
  yum install  nginx
5. Edit the httpd.conf & change the Listen port from 80 to 8085 
    vi /etc/httpd/httpd/config
6. Edit Nginx file and do the below changes ( Refer video for more details )
    vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    - change port
    - add reverse proxy setting
     













7.  Copy the index.html file from /tmp to /var/www/html/

        cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/







8. Start the httpd and nginx services 









9. validate the task by below commands 

	curl http://172.16.238.16:8095

	curl http://172.16.238.16:6000
