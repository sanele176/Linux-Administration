Question:   The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the 
latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. 
One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. 
They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, 
just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 8087 on all app servers.

Step 1. At first identify the app server which has issue by running the below commands
thor@jump_host ~$ telnet stapp01 8087
Trying 172.16.238.10...
telnet: connect to address 172.16.238.10: Connection refused

Step 2. login on app server which has connection refuse error & switch to root  
Step 3. check logs
    journalctl -xe -u httpd
Step 4. With the help of  netstat check which service is using your port and whats is PID. In below snipping ( refer to  below video for more details)
    netstat -tulnp
Step 5. Confirm the PID as per  the netstat output 
    ps -ef  |grep sendmail
Step 6. kill the service use same port as httpd
    kill (processID)
Step 7.  Start the httpd service & check the status.
 
Step 8.  Validate Apache HTTPd running  as per the task request
telnet stapp01 8087
